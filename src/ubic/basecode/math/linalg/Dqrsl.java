 * This class contains the LINPACK DQRDC (QR decomposition)
 * and DQRSL (QR solve) routines.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The "_j" suffixes indicate that these routines use
 * Java/C style indexing. For example, you will see
 *
 * for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
 *
 * rather than
 *
 * for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
 *
 * To use the "_j" routines you will have
 * to fill elements 0 through n - 1 rather than elements 1 through n.
 * Versions of these programs that use FORTYRAN style indexing are
 * also available. They end with the suffix "_f77".
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * This class was translated by a statistician from FORTRAN versions of
 * the LINPACK routines. It is NOT an official translation. When
 * public domain Java numerical analysis routines become available
 * from the people who produce LAPACK, then THE CODE PRODUCED
 * BY THE NUMERICAL ANALYSTS SHOULD BE USED.
 *

 * Meanwhile, if you have suggestions for improving this
 * code, please contact Steve Verrill at sverrill@fs.fed.us.

         * C
         * C DQRDC uses Householder transformations to compute the QR
         * C factorization of an N by P matrix X. Column pivoting
         * C based on the 2-norms of the reduced columns may be
         * C performed at the user's option.
         * C
         * C On Entry
         * C
         * C X DOUBLE PRECISION(LDX,P), where LDX .GE. N.
         * C X contains the matrix whose decomposition is to be
         * C computed.
         * C
         * C LDX INTEGER.
         * C LDX is the leading dimension of the array X.
         * C
         * C N INTEGER.
         * C N is the number of rows of the matrix X.
         * C
         * C P INTEGER.
         * C P is the number of columns of the matrix X.
         * C
         * C JPVT INTEGER(P).
         * C JPVT contains integers that control the selection
         * C of the pivot columns. The K-th column X(K) of X
         * C is placed in one of three classes according to the
         * C value of JPVT(K).
         * C
         * C If JPVT(K) .GT. 0, then X(K) is an initial
         * C column.
         * C
         * C If JPVT(K) .EQ. 0, then X(K) is a free column.
         * C
         * C If JPVT(K) .LT. 0, then X(K) is a final column.
         * C
         * C Before the decomposition is computed, initial columns
         * C are moved to the beginning of the array X and final
         * C columns to the end. Both initial and final columns
         * C are frozen in place during the computation and only
         * C free columns are moved. At the K-th stage of the
         * C reduction, if X(K) is occupied by a free column
         * C it is interchanged with the free column of largest
         * C reduced norm. JPVT is not referenced if
         * C JOB .EQ. 0.
         * C
         * C WORK DOUBLE PRECISION(P).
         * C WORK is a work array. WORK is not referenced if
         * C JOB .EQ. 0.
         * C
         * C JOB INTEGER.
         * C JOB is an integer that initiates column pivoting.
         * C If JOB .EQ. 0, no pivoting is done.
         * C If JOB .NE. 0, pivoting is done.

         * C On Return
         * C
         * C X X contains in its upper triangle the upper
         * C triangular matrix R of the QR factorization.
         * C Below its diagonal X contains information from
         * C which the orthogonal part of the decomposition
         * C can be recovered. Note that if pivoting has
         * C been requested, the decomposition is not that
         * C of the original matrix X but that of X
         * C with its columns permuted as described by JPVT.

         * C QRAUX DOUBLE PRECISION(P).
         * C QRAUX contains further information required to recover
         * C the orthogonal part of the decomposition.
         * C
         * C JPVT JPVT(K) contains the index of the column of the

         * c the decimal expansion abcde, with the following
         * c meaning.
         * c
         * c if a .ne. 0, compute qy.
         * c if b,c,d, or e .ne. 0, compute qty.
         * c if c .ne. 0, compute b.
         * c if d .ne. 0, compute rsd.
         * c if e .ne. 0, compute xb.
         * c
         * c note that a request to compute b, rsd, or xb
         * c automatically triggers the computation of qty, for
         * c which an array must be provided in the calling
         * c sequence.
         * c
         * c on return
         * c
         * c qy double precision(n).
         * c qy contains q*y, if its computation has been
         * c requested.
         * c
         * c qty double precision(n).
         * c qty contains trans(q)*y, if its computation has
         * c been requested. here trans(q) is the
         * c transpose of the matrix q.
         * c
         * c b double precision(k)
         * c b contains the solution of the least squares problem
         * c
         * c minimize norm2(y - xk*b),
         * c
         * c if its computation has been requested. (note that
         * c if pivoting was requested in dqrdc, the j-th
         * c component of b will be associated with column jpvt(j)
         * c of the original matrix x that was input into dqrdc.)
         * c
         * c rsd double precision(n).
         * c rsd contains the least squares residual y - xk*b,
         * c if its computation has been requested. rsd is
         * c also the orthogonal projection of y onto the
         * c orthogonal complement of the column space of xk.
         * c
         * c xb double precision(n).
         * c xb contains the least squares approximation xk*b,
         * c if its computation has been requested. xb is also
         * c the orthogonal projection of y onto the column space
         * c of x.
         * c
         * c info integer.
         * c info is zero unless the computation of b has
         * c been requested and r is exactly singular. in
         * c this case, info is the index of the first zero
         * c diagonal element of r and b is left unaltered.
         *
         *
         * For the Java version, info
         * is the return value of the the dqrsl_j method.
         *
         *
         * c
         * c the parameters qy, qty, b, rsd, and xb are not referenced
         * c if their computation is not requested and in this case
         * c can be replaced by dummy variables in the calling program.
         * c to save storage, the user may in some cases use the same
         * c array for different parameters in the calling sequence. a
         * c frequently occuring example is when one wishes to compute
         * c any of b, rsd, or xb and does not need y or qty. in this
         * c case one may identify y, qty, and one of b, rsd, or xb, while
         * c providing separate arrays for anything else that is to be
         * c computed. thus the calling sequence
         * c
         * c call dqrsl(x,ldx,n,k,qraux,y,dum,y,b,y,dum,110,info)
         * c
         * c will result in the computation of b and rsd, with rsd
         * c overwriting y. more generally, each item in the following
         * c list contains groups of permissible identifications for
         * c a single calling sequence.
         * c
         * c 1. (y,qty,b) (rsd) (xb) (qy)
